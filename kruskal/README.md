## Kruskal algorithm implementation in Python.

#

### Input data format
* In the first line there are two numbers: graph order and variant number (you can specify any)
* The following is a matrix of graph weights, separated by a space, with 0 indicating no edges

#
### Output data format
* The first line shows the total weight of the resulting frame
* The following is a line-by-line output of the frame weight matrix, separated by a comma and a space
* The last line in the format (a, b), (c, d), ... The edges added to the frame in the course of the algorithm's work are output.
